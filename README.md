## Task
This project aims to build a robust backend API that allows different applications to communicate seamlessly. The main challenge is ensuring secure user authentication and managing large datasets efficiently with features like pagination and caching.

## Description
To solve the problem, we designed an API that handles user authentication via OAuth tokens and offers CRUD operations for managing data. The API includes pagination to handle large datasets and uses Redis for caching to improve performance. Additionally, it provides comprehensive documentation using Swagger and Postman for easy integration and testing.

## Installation
To install this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Clone the repository and run npm install to install all dependencies. Ensure you have a Redis server running for caching.

## Usage
To start the application, use the command npm start. The API offers endpoints for user authentication and CRUD operations on the selected topic. You can use tools like Postman or Swagger to interact with the API and explore its features.
